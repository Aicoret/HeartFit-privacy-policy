# Privacy Policy

**Last updated: 28/03/2024**

Aicore Technologies ("us", "we", or "our") operates the HeartFit mobile application (the "Service").

This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our Service and the choices you have associated with that data.

## 1. Information Collection and Use

We collect several different types of information for various purposes to provide and improve our Service to you.

### Types of Data Collected

#### a. Personal Data

- **Pedometer**: The Pedometer section of our app collects data on your step count, distance traveled, and related fitness metrics. This data is used to track your activity levels and provide personalized fitness insights. All data collected by the Pedometer section is stored locally on your device and is not transmitted or shared with any third parties.

- **HeartRate Measurement**: The HeartRate measurement section of our app utilizes your device's camera to measure your heart rate. This tool works by measuring the amount of red it sees through the camera, and try to detect the fluctuations. It works better in a darkened room, and when the pressure on the camera is constant. No images or videos are saved during this process, and all data is processed locally on your device without being transmitted or shared with any third parties.

- **Tools**: The Tools section of our app combines Body Mass Index (BMI) computation and Waist-Hip Ratio (WHR) computation. We may collect personal data such as height, weight, waist circumference, and hip circumference to perform these computations. This data is used solely for the purpose of providing you with health and fitness information. All data collected by the Tools section is stored locally on your device and is not transmitted or shared with any third parties.

#### b. Usage Data

We may also collect information on how the Service is accessed and used ("Usage Data") to improve user experience and optimize app performance. This Usage Data may include information such as your device's Internet Protocol address, device type, device operating system, the pages of our Service that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages, and other diagnostic data. However, please note that none of this Usage Data is transmitted or shared with any third parties. It is solely used for internal purposes to analyze and improve the functionality of our Service.
