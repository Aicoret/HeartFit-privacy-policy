### 1.1 Types of Data Collected

#### a. Personal Data

- **Pedometer**:
  - The Pedometer feature tracks your step count, distance traveled, speed, and related fitness metrics.
  - This data is used to monitor activity levels, provide personalized fitness insights, and calculate metrics such as calorie burn.
  - All data collected by the Pedometer section is stored locally on your device and is not transmitted or shared with third parties.

- **Heart Rate Measurement**:
  - The Heart Rate feature uses your device’s camera to measure your heart rate by detecting fluctuations in the red color detected through the camera.
  - This process works best in a dark environment with consistent pressure on the camera.
  - No images or videos are saved during this process, and all data is processed locally on your device without being transmitted or shared with third parties.

- **Tools**:
  - The Tools section includes:
    - **Body Mass Index (BMI)** and **Waist-Hip Ratio (WHR)** calculations.
  - For these computations, personal data such as height, weight, waist circumference, and hip circumference may be collected.
  - This data is used exclusively to provide health and fitness information and is stored locally on your device without being transmitted or shared.

  - We may collect information about how the Service is accessed and used. This may include:
    - Device type and operating system.
    - Internet Protocol (IP) address.
    - Pages of the Service visited and the time spent on those pages.
    - Diagnostic and performance data.
  - This data is anonymized, stored locally, and used solely for internal purposes to improve the Service’s performance and user experience.

- **UI Feedback Integration**:
